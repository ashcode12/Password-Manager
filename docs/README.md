# Password Manager - DevOps Project

## Project Overview

**Project Title**: Web-Based Password Manager with DevOps Pipeline  
**Objective**: Develop a secure, cloud-based password manager using DevOps practices, including continuous integration, automated testing, and cloud deployment.

## Project Phases and Progress

### Phase 1: Planning and Research
- Defined the projectâ€™s core functionality:
  - Password storage with encryption, retrieval, and listing capabilities.
- Security Requirements:
  - Passwords are encrypted using AES-256 before being stored.
  - Integrated with Firestore on GCP for persistent storage, using secure service accounts.
- Tool Selection:
  - **Backend**: Node.js with Express for API routing.
  - **Database**: Firestore on GCP for secure data storage.
  - **Encryption**: Node.js `crypto` library for strong password encryption.

### Phase 2: Development Setup and Version Control
- Project Folder Structure:
  - `/src`: Main application code (API routes, encryption functions).
  - `/tests`: Placeholder for future test files.
  - `/docs`: Documentation for the project.
- Initial Server Setup:
  - Created a Node.js Express server with API routes for password management.
- Version Control and Branching:
  - Set up GitHub repository with `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files.
  - Branching strategy: `main`, `dev`, and feature branches for clear project tracking.
